This is my capstone project for Thinkful's Front End Web Development unit. This app helps users see a list of recipes (using Edamam's API) that include the individual ingredients they search for. Enter in the contents of your fridge or pantry and make a meal with what you have.

The code utilized here is HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), JavaScript, and jQuery. I've utilized Edamam's recipe search API (https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api) to display the results. Direct any inquiries to huntermotte@gmail.com.
